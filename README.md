# Kata Template
Hey! This is a simple set of templates for jumping straight in to problem solving in various languages, for use in a kata-like sitation (codewars, advent of code, etc)

## Setting up environments
This guide will assume some basic familiarity with a CLI (command line interface), if you haven't used one before I would recommend setting up [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on windows, or just use bash if you are on linux/mac
### JavaScript
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Navigate bash to ./JavaScript
- Run the command
```node solution.js```, or swap in the name of the file you have created

### C#
- Install [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net80)
- Navigate bash to ./C#
- Run the command
```dotnet run```, or swap in the name of the file you have created

### Python
- Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Navigate bash to ./Python
- If you want to you can set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (this is considered good practise but is not required)
- Run the command
```py solution.py```, or swap in the name of the file you have created
